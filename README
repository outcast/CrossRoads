This is a pre pre release, there is still some work to be done, examples, and a tutorial of how to set up and use this framework... also i think an sql file is missing for the necessary database. Give me a week or two to start coming up with these things...

Needed:

A real README
Setup instructions
database setup file
test service
test module example
